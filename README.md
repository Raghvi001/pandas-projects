# pandas-projects


This repository contains my hands-on practice while learning Pandas for
Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Topics Covered
- Creating DataFrames
- Handling missing values (NaN)
- Mean imputation
- Basic data exploration

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- # Student Marks Analysis

This project demonstrates basic data analysis using Python.

## Dataset
Marks of students in Maths, English, and Science.

## Tasks Performed
- Load CSV data using Pandas
- Calculate total marks
- Classify students as Pass/Fail
- Visualize results using a pie chart

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ### Data Visualization
- Line plot showing average marks per subject
- Scatter plot showing relationship between subject scores
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performed group-based analysis to compare average subject scores for pass vs fail students.
- Visualized relationships between subjects using scatter plots to identify correlations and outliers.
- Used Matplotlib for clean, readable data storytelling.
